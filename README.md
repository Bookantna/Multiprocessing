# Multiprocessing Image Filtering

This research project aims to investigate the potential performance improvements achieved by employing multiprocessing compared to sequential execution in image filtering processes.


This project involves testing three filters:

- Gaussian blur
- Mean filter (Box Blur)
- Edge detection
